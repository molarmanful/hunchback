## Requirements

## Installation

## Perks

Perk | Description
|---|---
1 - Spineless | 20% dodge + 15% dodge when crouching
3 - Coward's Respite | 50% faster reload when crouching
5 - Rat King | 10% faster movement speed, 20% faster crouching movement speed
7 - Roach Tactics | Dodging replenishes armor, 1sec invulnerability on armor break (5sec cooldown)
9 - Surprise Lobotomy | 25% more headshot damage, armor and health on headshot kill (20 armor; health is given logarithmically, i.e. less health means more regen and more health means less regen)

## Playstyle

This perk deck is built around crouching and headshot killing. Crouching gives extra dodge, faster reloads, and -- indirectly -- extra potential armor regen. Headshot kills give armor and health. As a safety blanket, armor breaks yield 1 second of invulnerability with a 5 second cooldown, similar to anarchist's armor break mechanic.

Most of the perks are recognizably derived from existing perk decks, but due to the lack of "concrete" survivability buffs to armor/health/damage reduction, the perk deck may feel quite "glassy" at times. Proper positioning around enemies and cover is highly recommended, if not required, if you want to get the most out of this build.

In terms of weapon choice, I would generally recommend snipers, high-stat DMRs/assault rifles/SMGs, although any weapon that can headshot will probably work. I found that snipers work really well; if you can line up collateral headshots, you can regen multiple stacks of armor and health.
